# Fragment_Analysis
This was my work on the fragment analysis work that was done before. this jupyter notebook can be used to calculate the accleration of fragemnts from the chamber pressure expericenced. It can also calculate the velocity of said fragments. It will also create an excel sheet containing a n x n amount of velocities, forces that vary depending on the fragment size and the pressures.

When working with this juypter notebook please only change constants that are outlined as such. Do not mess with any variables that are not clearly labeled as constants or inputs
